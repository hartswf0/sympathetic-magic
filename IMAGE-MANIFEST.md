## IMAGE 04-06: POOR IMAGE DEGRADATION SERIES
**Location:** view-04.html, Section 4 (Circulation & Poor Images)  
**Purpose:** Show Hito Steyerl's "poor image" concept through progressive compression

### Series Structure:
Three progressive stages showing image degradation through circulation

#### STAGE 2: First Compression
- **Effect:** Subtle blur (CSS: filter: blur(0.5px))
- **Visual:** JPEG blocking begins to appear
- **Resolution:** Reduced to ~1080px
- **File size:** 500 KB - 2 MB
- **Platform:** Social media compression (Instagram/Twitter-like)

#### STAGE 3: Screenshot & Remix  
- **Effect:** Heavy blur (CSS: filter: blur(1px); image-rendering: pixelated)
- **Visual:** Heavy compression, pixelation visible, original context lost
- **Resolution:** ~720px or lower
- **File size:** 200-500 KB
- **Context:** Meme-ified, text overlays, decontextualized

#### STAGE 4: Infinite Circulation
- **Effect:** Extreme blur (CSS: filter: blur(2px); image-rendering: pixelated)
- **Visual:** Extreme degradation, barely recognizable, pure circulation
- **Resolution:** ~480px or lower
- **File size:** 50-100 KB
- **Context:** Completely divorced from original; author unknown

### Source Image Options:
Could use:
1. A famous artwork (public domain) showing degradation
2. Create original image, then degrade it through actual platforms
3. Use meme that has documented circulation history
4. Historical photograph with known circulation path

### Creation Method:
1. Start with high-resolution public domain image
2. Apply progressive JPEG compression (save at 80%, 50%, 20% quality)
3. Add actual screenshot artifacts
4. Resize progressively smaller
5. Apply CSS filters for presentation

## IMAGE 07: APPROPRIATED DESIGN
**Location:** view-04.html, Section 5 (Appropriation & Cultural Power)  
**Purpose:** Show cultural appropriation through design extraction

### Specifications:
- **Subject:** Commercial product using indigenous/cultural designs
- **Style:** GRAYSCALE, split composition
- **Elements:** 
  - Left: Original cultural artifact/pattern
  - Right: Commercial product using that pattern
  - Center: Arrow showing appropriation
- **Annotation:** "No attribution" visible

### Examples to Research:
1. **Fashion Industry:**
   - Indigenous patterns on mass-market clothing
   - African prints on fast fashion
   - Native American designs on accessories

2. **Home Decor:**
   - Tribal patterns on mass-produced rugs
   - Sacred symbols on decorative objects
   - Cultural motifs on furniture

3. **Documented Cases:**
   - Urban Outfitters indigenous design controversies
   - Fashion brands appropriating Mexican embroidery
   - Yoga brand using sacred Hindu symbols

### Creation Options:
1. **Documentary Approach:** Use documented appropriation cases with proper attribution
2. **Educational Composite:** Create side-by-side showing:
   - Museum artifact (properly sourced)
   - Generic commercial product with similar pattern
   - Clear "inspired by without permission" annotation

### Ethical Requirements:
- Do not create new appropriation by using actual cultural designs
- Use well-documented cases with proper attribution
- Include context about community response
- Credit source community and advocates

## ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT NEEDS

### For view-03.html:
The file uses minimal imagery (mainly the SVG mission patch), but could benefit from:

1. **Case Study Images:**
   - Wendy Ewald "Portraits and Dreams" - children's photography
   - Elizabeth Barret "Stranger with a Camera" - documentary still
   - Voice casting examples - animation stills showing casting debates

2. **Visual Diagrams:**
   - Risk/duty matrices as visual flowcharts
   - Morphism relationships as node graphs
   - Entity-relationship diagrams

### Search Resources:

**Public Domain Archives:**
- Library of Congress (loc.gov)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art (metmuseum.org)
- Rijksmuseum (rijksmuseum.nl)
- Wikimedia Commons
- Internet Archive

**Cultural Context:**
- Local Contexts Initiative

## ETHICAL CHECKLIST

Before using any image, verify:

- [ ] **License verified** - Public domain or properly licensed
- [ ] **Source credited** - Institution, creator, date documented
- [ ] **Context preserved** - Cultural/historical context maintained
- [ ] **Subject dignity** - Vulnerable subjects treated with respect
- [ ] **Fair use justified** - If not public domain, educational fair use documented
- [ ] **Provenance traced** - Full chain of custody documented
- [ ] **Consent documented** - Historical consent issues acknowledged
- [ ] **Alternative considered** - Could mockup/illustration work instead?

## NOTES

This presentation practices what it preaches: every image must follow the ethical framework it describes. Image selection and attribution are themselves acts of representation that carry ethical weight.

The metadata sections are not decorative—they're operational. They demonstrate [trace], [contextualize], and [consent-seek] morphisms in action.

**Status:** Ready for image research and development  
**Next Steps:** Begin systematic search using recommended sources and search terms
