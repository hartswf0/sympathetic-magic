# W12S24: Sympathetic Interfaces — Magic Rules Still Rule
**Session 24 | Thursday, November 6, 2025**

---

## Core Concept
**Interfaces work because magic rules still rule.**

The principles of sympathetic magic—similarity and contagion—aren't anthropological curiosities. They are the operating system of modern media. Every photograph, every data profile, every digital representation functions according to Frazer's laws. Understanding this reveals the ethical stakes of representation.

---

## Key Question
**How do sympathetic magic's principles shape the ethics of representing memory, identity, community in media?**

When we create representations (photographs, videos, data profiles, documentaries), we're not making neutral copies. We're performing acts of *magical transfer* with real-world consequences:

- **[similarity]** → "Like affects like" — The representation IS treated as the thing itself
- **[association]** → "Contact leaves trace" — Once connected, the link persists forever

These principles create ethical obligations around consent, context, circulation, and repair.

---

## Session Prompt
**Use Frazer's laws to analyze a photographic/filmic project (Portraits and Dreams, Stranger with a Camera). How does its "magic" raise ethical questions?**

### Analysis Framework:
1. **Identify the magical operation:**
   - What kind of representation is being created?
   - What similarities are being invoked?
   - What contact/contagion is occurring?

2. **Trace the ethical implications:**
   - Who controls the representation?
   - How does it circulate?
   - What power dynamics are at play?
   - What consent was (or wasn't) obtained?

3. **Apply ethical morphisms:**
   - `[contextualize]` — Preserve full provenance
   - `[consent-seek]` — Obtain ongoing permission
   - `[trace]` — Maintain lineage
   - `[pluralize]` — Include counter-voices
   - `[repair]` — Offer remedy when harm occurs

Browser-based poor image degradation generator implementing Hito Steyerl's concept.

**Features:**
- Download Migrant Mother from Library of Congress
- Upload custom images
- Generate 4 degradation stages automatically
- Demonstrates circulation vs. quality trade-off

**Stages:**
1. **Original** — High resolution source
2. **Stage 2** — First compression (1080px, 60% quality) — Social media platform compression
3. **Stage 3** — Screenshot & Remix (720px, 30% quality) — Heavy artifacts, decontextualized
4. **Stage 4** — Infinite Circulation (480px, 15% quality) — Extreme degradation, author unknown

**Theoretical Framework:**  
Hito Steyerl (2009): "The poor image is a copy in motion... distributed for free... compressed... ripped... remixed."

## Ethical Framework: Sympathetic Principles Applied

### **Domain: Memory**
**Risks:**
- `[overwrite]` — Replacing authentic memory with constructed version
- `[sanitize]` — Removing complexity and context
- `[mislead]` — False historical narratives
- `[retrigger]` — Causing trauma through re-exposure

**Duties:**
- `[contextualize]` — Preserve full provenance and framing
- `[consent-seek]` — Ongoing permission from stakeholders
- `[trace]` — Maintain lineage and attribution
- `[slow-down]` — Add friction to prevent rapid viral spread

**Case Study:** Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother" (1936)  
Florence Owens Thompson later expressed regret about being photographed without understanding how widely the image would circulate. The photograph became iconic, but Thompson never controlled or benefited from its circulation—a violation of both consent and reciprocity.

---

### **Domain: Identity**
**Risks:**
- `[impute]` — Assigning group traits to individuals
- `[adhere]` — Sticky categorization that persists
- `[bleed]` — Categorical collapse of group to person
- `[stick]` — Durable negative associations

**Duties:**
- `[co-author]` — Shared narrative authority
- `[disaggregate]` — Separate individual from group
- `[minimize]` identifiers — Reduce unnecessary markers
- `[audit-casting]` — Check representation choices

**Case Study:** Voice Casting Ethics  
When actors voice characters of different identities, the similarity principle creates stick associations. Ethical practice requires co-authorship with affected communities and transparency about casting rationale.

---

### **Domain: Community**
**Risks:**
- `[stand-in]` — Individual represents entire group
- `[flatten]` — Collapse internal diversity
- `[cluster]` — Forced taxonomic grouping
- `[stigmatize]` — Negative group marking

**Duties:**
- `[pluralize]` — Show multiple perspectives
- `[reciprocate]` — Mutual benefit exchange
- `[govern]` taxonomies — Community control over categories
- `[steward]` long-term data — Ongoing care

**Case Study:** Stranger with a Camera  
Documentary footage of Appalachian communities circulated without community input, creating lasting harmful stereotypes. Ethical documentary requires pluralized voices, reciprocal benefit, and community governance over how they're represented.

---

## Operational Morphisms

### **[AUDIT]**
Check casting, metadata, lineage. Identify where similarity or association creates vulnerability.

### **[LIMIT-PROPAGATION]**
Reduce reach radius, add friction, implement takedown protocols. Control how traces travel through networks.

### **[REPAIR]**
Offer compensation, counter-narrative, trace-maps. Address harm after stick or propagate has occurred.

### **[EVALUATE]**
Risk scoring, licensing, consent scaling. Pre-production assessment of risk-matrix dimensions.

---

## Heuristics (Shop Standards)

### **1. LIKENESS IS LEVERAGE**
When `[similarity]` increases, apply `[co-author]`, `[contextualize]`, `[audit-casting]`.  
**Guidance:** The more closely representation resembles referent, the stronger the ethical duty to involve stakeholders.

### **2. TRACES TRAVEL**
When radius of `[association]` expands, add `[trace]`, `[limit-propagation]`, `[steward]`.  
**Guidance:** As reach grows through networks, increase provenance tracking and propagation controls.

### **3. COUNTER-LIKENESS PROTECTS**
`[pluralize]` with counter-examples.  
**Guidance:** Break stereotype patterns by showing diverse instances. Multiple representations weaken singular stick effects.

### **4. CONSENT SCALES WITH STICKINESS**
Strengthen `[consent-seek]` and `[repair]` as associative persistence rises.  
**Guidance:** The more durable and propagable the representation, the more robust consent protocols must be.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging with this material, you should be able to:

1. **Identify** sympathetic magic principles in media representations
2. **Analyze** how similarity and contagion create ethical stakes
3. **Apply** ethical morphisms to real-world case studies
4. **Evaluate** the power dynamics in documentary/photographic projects
5. **Create** representations that honor consent, context, and community governance

---

## Key Takeaways

### **Sympathetic Magic is Not Primitive**
Rozin et al. (2005) demonstrated that even Ivy League students exhibit sympathetic magical thinking. It's a persistent cognitive pattern, not a cultural artifact.

### **Representation = Magical Transfer**
Every photograph, video, data profile, or documentary is an act of magical transfer with real consequences. The ethical question is not *whether* magic occurs, but *how we govern it*.

### **The Poor Image Paradox**
As image quality degrades through circulation, its power often increases. The "poor image" (Steyerl) becomes a trace of itself—degraded yet more viral, stripped of context yet more influential.

### **Contagion Persists**
Once data touches an identity, the connection is permanent. Data breaches, surveillance archives, and platform aggregation demonstrate that "once in contact, always in contact."

### **Community Governance is Essential**
Ethical representation requires ceding control to stakeholders. Participatory methods, co-authorship, and ongoing consent are not optional—they're fundamental.
